### 0.5.0

_Released 2025 Jan 01_

#### Improvements

- Updated the default LWJGL version to 3.3.5. [[GH-49](https://github.com/Osmerion/gradle-lwjgl3/issues/49)]
- By default, a platform is now implicitly created for the host system (if it is
  supported).
  - This platform can be identified by the `isImplicitHostPlatform` property.
  - The purpose of this platform is to provide more convenient development
    experience. The implicit platform should be filtered when creating
    distributions.
- Experimentally exposed the match functions for `Architecture` and
  `OperatingSystem` as public API.

#### Fixes

- Added missing `@JvmOverloads` annotation to the `freebsdX64` convenience
  function.
- A dependency on the core module is now automatically added to the libraries
  and natives configurations if at least one module is required.
  - Due to this change, it is no longer necessary to manually add the core
    module when using other modules.

#### Breaking Changes

- Increased the minimum required Java version to 11 (from 8).
