### 0.5.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Updated the default LWJGL version to 3.3.5. [[GH-49]](https://github.com/Osmerion/gradle-lwjgl3/issues/49)
- By default, a platform is now implicitly created for the host system (if it is
  supported).
  - This platform can be identified by the `isImplicitHostPlatform` property.
  - The purpose of this platform is to provide more convenient development
    experience. The implicit platform should be filtered when creating
    distributions.

#### Fixes

- Added missing `@JvmOverloads` annotation to `freebsdX64` convenience function.
